## 1. Summary

This assignment's goal is for you to practice the structural and behavioural modelling of a high-level architecture based on a case study inspired by realistic requirements from industry. These models will be developed using the C4 architectural notation.

## 2. Case Study Description

### 2.1. Background

Modern businesses crucially depend on obtaining and processing quality data for efficient decision-making. One of the major issues is that such data is often scattered across multiple sources which makes data acquisition a very expensive process. For example, in the area of finance, there are multiple data sources such as:

- Stock market feeds
- News providers
- Regulatory reports
- Macroeconomic announcements

Often the mechanisms to acquire the data are very different. In some cases, data can be downloaded, in other cases it has to be scraped from web pages. In other cases, it needs to be extracted from PDF reports and in some cases, it is available via API calls.

In this case study, we assume that you are working as part of a financial institution that wants to build a platform that ingests data from different **price information feeds**. This data is then supplied to its customers via alerts and notifications.

## 3. User requirements

The list of user requirements are as follows:

- You need to design a data serving platform for a financial institution that regularly ingests, stores, and serves price information from different data sources on behalf of its customers
- A data source in this case is a price feed which can be historical or real-time prices. Historical data is often in simple text files (like CSV file) that can be downloaded. An example of a data source is [Yahoo Finance](https://au.finance.yahoo.com/)
- In general, customers prefer avoiding going to a data source directly and prefer to get it from the financial institution.
- Customers can be traders, investors, and individuals. Customers would like **prices timeseries** that are customised to their needs.
- Customers like to get prices timeseries in a specific **data format**. For example, an Excel spreadsheet that contains a clean timeseries with a particular frequency (like daily, hourly, minute-level prices).
- Customers also want to be able to specify alerts/notifications for particular **events**. For example, a customer may specify “Please send me an alert when Stock A price rises above $1.”
- **Only the following four data sources may be used to ingest price data:**
  - [Investing.com](https://www.investing.com)
  - [Stooq.com](https://stooq.com)
  - [Yahoo Finance](https://au.finance.yahoo.com)
  - [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co)

## 4. Architecture needed

As a first step in building a solution, you need to design an architecture that offers the following advantages:

- It has to support any type of price feeds with different data acquisition methods. We assume that these methods may change over time &mdash; for example, a change in a website's URL or in an API endpoint
- It has to support pre-processing and cleaning of the data to fit customers' data format requirements
- It has to support alerts to notify customers when a specific type of event arises.

## 5. Assignment Requirements

### 5.1. Overall Tasks

In this assignment, there are 3 tasks:

1. Define the 3 most important **use cases** that correspond to the requirements of the case study.
2. Define two architecture diagrams (**Context and Container**) that supports the use cases using the C4 notation.
3. For one of your use cases, define a **sequence diagram** showing how components in your Container diagram interact over time

### 5.2. Task 1: Defining the Use cases (7 marks)

Based on the analysis of the requirements, define your 3 most important use cases. These use cases represent the high priority requirements that need to be supported by the architecture. They should cover all main features of the solution. Each use case must:

- Have a clear name and support a very specific user function
- Be defined in a way that only illustrates the user's perspective (not technology or implementation dependent)

For each use case you need to include:

- **Name:** Title of the use case
- **Description:** Brief description of the use case.
- **Primary Actors:** The user(s) interacting in the system
- **Preconditions:** Conditions that must be met before the use case starts
- **Postconditions:** What is a changed as a result of the completed use case
- **Trigger:** What causes the use case to start?
- **Main Flow:** The sequence of interactions in a successful use case
- **Exceptional Flow:** The sequence of interactions in the event of an error. You only need to cover 1 error case. You do not need to cover all possible errors

### 5.3. Task 2: Defining the Architecture (18 marks)

To collectively support all of the use cases, you need to produce 2 architecture diagrams:

- **C4 System Context Level diagram**: showing your system + users + neighbouring systems. This is useful for Business stakeholders, execs and non-tech users.
- **C4 Container Level diagram**: showing major application/components like web apps, APIs, DBs. This is useful for developers, tech leads and architects.

Please make sure that:

- The names of common entities (components and relations) in the 2 diagrams are matching as one is a further decomposition of the other.
- Good C4 design rules have been followed.
- Only one set of context and container diagrams are created. You do **NOT** need to create a context and container diagram for each use case.

**In addition to the diagrams, answer the following:**

Consider 2 decisions you made when designing the architecture. Justify why you made those decisions (1-2 sentences each), referencing the use cases in the justification of at least 1 of your decisions.

### 5.4. Task 3: Defining the behaviour (10 marks)

For one of the use cases identified in Task 1, create a sequence diagram that illustrates how the architecture is supporting the use case. Make sure that:

- Each component (vertical line) in the sequence diagram corresponds to a C4 component, either external (from System context level) or internal (from the Container diagram).
- Invocations between components have to be clearly labelled according to good design rules in sequence diagrams.
