# 1. Assignment Parts

**This assignment has two parts, of which this is the first**. The first part assesses the first half of the course, focusing on design principles and patterns. The second part, to be released in Monday Week 8, will assess system architecture.

# 2. Getting Started

You can access your repository through the [course website](https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs2511/25T3/assignments)

> For this assignment, you will need to make a blog post which contains the answers to questions and links to your code changes. [You can view instructions and templates for this blogging here](#5-blogging).

You can also check out [this video](https://www.loom.com/share/6bdd612614014a96b801de72f8b5a2c1?sid=5c47d8fe-eada-4346-87e0-5b7d36ae9c3f) to help you get started on part 1 of the assignment.

# 3. Tasks

This part of the assignment consists of two core tasks. **We strongly recommend reading the entire specification before starting**, as earlier tasks may introduce design decisions or code that influence later tasks.

## Task 1) Code Analysis and Refactoring (30 marks) ⚙️

In this task, you will need to analyse the design of the monolith, including the patterns and smells present in the implementation, and apply refactoring techniques discussed in the course in order to improve the quality of the code.

> ### Instructions for Task 1:
>
> Put all of your answers to the following theory questions in your **blog post**.
>
> For each refactoring change, **before you start coding** take some time to plan and write up a design in your blog post. This should include:
>
> - What fields/methods you will need to add/change in a class
> - What new classes/packages you will need to create
>
> **After you finish coding**, make a Merge Request into the `main` branch of your repository with the following:
>
> - A meaningful MR title that encompasses the changes
> - A brief description which outlines the changes being made
> - Make sure to keep the MR as small as possible - don't make any extra changes that aren’t absolutely necessary. Try to keep the number of files the changes touch to a minimum.
> - Make sure all the Continuous Integration checks (regression tests, linting, coverage) remain passing.
>
> Make sure to do this for each part of the question - **if you don't you will lose marks**.

### a) From DRY to Design Patterns (6 marks)

- i. Look inside `app/src/main/java/dungeonmania/entities/enemies`. Where can you notice an instance of repeated code? Note down the particular offending lines/methods/fields.
- ii. What Design Pattern could be used to improve the quality of the code and avoid repetition? Justify your choice by relating the scenario to the key characteristics of your chosen Design Pattern.
- iii. Using your chosen Design Pattern, refactor the code to remove the repetition.

### b) Inheritance Design (6 marks)

Currently, there is a flaw in the inheritance structure of collectables. A note from a member of the previous engineering team says:

> I don't understand why some collectable items like Wood and Treasure have durability and do things like apply buffs, especially when they're not being used in battle anyway.

- i. List one design principle that is violated by collectable objects based on the description above. Briefly justify your answer.
- ii. Refactor the **inheritance structure** of the code, and in the process remove the design principle violation you identified.

### c) Open-Closed Goals (6 marks)

Look inside the goals package at the code provided.

- i. Do you think the design is of good quality here? Do you think it complies with the open-closed principle? Do you think the design should be changed?
- ii. If you think the design is sufficient as it is, justify your decision. If you think the answer is no, pick a suitable Design Pattern that would improve the quality of the code and refactor the code accordingly.

### d) Open Refactoring (12 marks)

Make any other refactoring improvements you see fit to the codebase. This can include resolving code smells, violations of design principles, using Design Patterns discussed or any other general improvements to the health and quality of the code.

Some areas and questions you can consider:

- Consider violations of the Law of Demeter and the Liskov substitution principle.
- Some classes such as `Exit` contain a number of common empty and unused methods. This might be a symptom of a deeper issue with the inheritance structure.
- The current implementation of the crafting system for buildable entities contains a significant amount of hard coding. Think about how you can improve this.
- If you run `gradle test`, you will see a warning about "deprecated" methods in the codebase. What is the significance of this message? What should you, as the programmer, do with the code?

The above list isn’t exhaustive; there are plenty of other areas to improve the quality of the code.

Some hints for this task:

> 🥇 You don't need to have a perfect design to achieve full marks for this task. Some code smells or design problems may be disproportionately difficult or even impossible to refactor, given the nature of the assignment. It is recommended that you aim for "low-hanging fruit" before judging if you need to attempt more difficult refactors.
>
> 🧠 Don't make solutions to problems that don’t exist yet! :) Avoid over-engineering or over-abstracting in places where you might want to improve the design for some future change in requirements - instead improve the design of the current system. This will inherently make your software open-closed.

**You’ll also want to split this task into one MR for each refactoring change you make.**

## Task 2) Evolution of Requirements (30 marks) 🔧

In this task, you must complete **either** _Sun Stone & More Buildables_ (Option 1) **or** _Logic Switches_ (Option 2). To receive full marks, you must complete Option 2 — Logic Switches. Submissions for Option 1 — Sun Stone & More Buildables will be capped at **20/30**.

You do not need to do any frontend modifications for any of these tasks, and will not be assessed on any frontend material.

You should create a new folder for your tests called `task2` and place all your tests inside of it.

Your marks **will be capped** at 50% if a significant attempt is not made on this task. A significant attempt is defined as creating all the necessary classes, relationships, and functionalities for the task. Whether your implementation is correct or well designed does not affect whether it is considered a significant attempt.

### Software Delivery &mdash; Task Lifecycle

If you've done Task 1 well and have a nice healthy codebase, this task should be relatively straightforward! If you're finding parts of this task difficult to integrate with the existing design, that's probably a sign you need to do some more refactoring.

> ♻️ A note about **backwards compatibility**:
>
> - **All** the regression tests we have provided to you in the starter code should remain passing.
> - All of the MVP configuration files (in the provided config files) do not currently contain the fields listed in the technical specification for this task. Rather than retroactively adding these fields to the existing configuration files, you will need to design your implementation to accommodate for this and maintain backwards compatibility. **All configuration files in our Task 2 autotests will contain all values from Task 2** and the MVP.

### Option 1 &mdash; Sun Stone & More Buildables (20 marks)

In this task, the following collectable entities need to be added:

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th><span style="font-weight:bold">Entity</span></th>
    <th><span style="font-weight:bold">Image</span></th>
    <th><span style="font-weight:bold">Description</span></th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Sun Stone</td>
    <td><img src='/images/sunstone.png' /></td>
    <td>A special form of treasure, hard and treasuable. It can be picked up by the player. Can be used to open any door. Since it is classed as treasure it counts towards the treasure goal, but it cannot be used to bribe mercenaries. Can also be used interchangeably with treasure or keys when building entities, though if the player possesses enough treasure or keys those should be preferred when crafting. When used for opening doors, or when replacing another material such as a key or treasure in building entities, it is retained after use. When used as a listed ingredient in crafting, it is consumed. Sunstones will always be prioritised to be used as a listed ingredient before serving as a replacement material.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The following buildable entities have also been added:

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th><span style="font-weight:bold">Entity</span></th>
    <th><span style="font-weight:bold">Image</span></th>
    <th><span style="font-weight:bold">Description</span></th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Sceptre</td>
    <td><img src='/images/sceptre.png' /></td>
    <td>Can be crafted with (1 wood OR 2 arrows) + (1 key OR 1 treasure) + (1 sun stone). A player with a sceptre does not need to bribe mercenaries to become allies, as they can use the sceptre to control their minds without any distance constraint. They can do so by interacting with the particular mercenary they wish to mind control. Mind control has the same effects as bribing, but the effects only last for a certain number of ticks. This number of ticks begins counting down immediately after the sceptre is used.
    <details margin-top="5px">
        <br>
        <summary>Example</summary>
        In a case where the sceptre's duration is 2 ticks:
        <ul>
            <li>Tick 1 - player's turn: Player mind controls enemy. </li>
            <li>Tick 1 - enemy's turn: Enemy is mind controlled. </li>
            <li>Tick 2 - player's turn: Player moves. </li>
            <li>Tick 2 - enemy's turn: Enemy is mind controlled. </li>
            <li>Tick 3 - player's turn: Player moves. </li>
            <li>Tick 3 - enemy's turn: Enemy is no longer mind controlled. </li>
        </ul>
        </details>
    <br>
    Other than the standard behaviour of allying mercenaries, sceptres do not have any direct effect in battle.
    The behaviour after a sceptre is used is not specified and will not be tested: it can be destroyed, retained, etc.
   </td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Midnight Armour</td>
    <td><img src='/images/midnight_armour.png' /></td>
    <td>Can be crafted with (1 sword + 1 sun stone) if there are no zombies currently in the dungeon. Midnight armour provides extra attack damage as well as protection, and it lasts forever.</td>
  </tr>

</tbody>
</table>

> **Where otherwise unspecified, if there are multiple valid options for crafting an item, the precedence of items consumed is undefined.**

#### Technical Specification

The list of inputs in [Section 4.1.1. of the MVP specification](./MVP.md#411-input-specification---entities-mvp) now includes the following entities:

> You may find `NameConverter.java` particularly useful in ensuring your response objects match these strings for automarking.

<table>

  </td>
    <td>Yes</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Sceptre</td>

    <td>No, since this entity must be built by the player.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Midnight Armour</td>
    <td>
    <code>midnight_armour</code>
  </td>
    <td>No, since this entity must be built by the player.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The list of configuration fields in [Section 4.2.1. of the MVP specification](./MVP.md#421-configuration-fields-mvp) now includes the following fields:

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th style="font-weight:bold">JSON Format<br></th>

</table>

You will not be given any test cases where `mind_control_duration` is less than or equal to 0.

The following interface methods in [Section 4.3.2. of the MVP specification](./MVP.md#432-interface-methods) are now updated:

<thead>
  <tr>
    <th style="font-weight:bold">Method Prototype<br></th>

    <li>If the player is not cardinally adjacent to the spawner, if they are destroying a spawner</li>
    <li> If the player does not have a weapon and attempts to destroy a spawner</li>
    </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Option 2 &mdash; Logic Switches (30 marks)

There are three new entities in this extension:

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th><span style="font-weight:bold">Entity</span></th>
    <th><span style="font-weight:bold">Image</span></th>
    <th><span style="font-weight:bold">Description</span></th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Light Bulb</td>
    <td><img src='/images/light_bulb.png' /></td>
    <td>Light bulbs cannot be collected, but can be lit up by satisfying the logical condition. They are always created as a logical entity.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Switch Door</td>
    <td><img src='/images/switch_door.png' /></td>
    <td>Switch doors behave the same as normal doors, except they have a different opening mechanism. They are always created as a logical entity, and can be opened when their logical condition is satisfied.
    They cannot be opened with a key. The door should only remain open as long as its condition for opening is still true.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Wire</td>
    <td><img src='/images/wire.png' /></td>
    <td>Wires cannot be collected, but act as a conductor to pass current between switches and logical entities. Wires themselves do not follow logical rules. Any moveable entity can walk onto a wire.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

If a switch is activated, it sends a current to any cardinally adjacent wires and logical entities. Current can be conducted through **wires and activated switches only** (conductors), meaning that a logical entity may be activated directly by a switch if cardinally adjacent, or indirectly by a cardinally adjacent current-carrying wire. This allows for the creation of dungeons with logic circuits. For example:

![](images/logic_circuit.png)

<center style="opacity:0.7">Current from the switch on (3, 1) is propagated through the wires on (4, 1) and (5, 1) to activate the bulb on (6, 1).</center>
</br>

All logical entities will be created in an off state.

#### a) Logical Entities

Some entities are "logical" entities with a specified configuration value. These entities will only activate if their logical condition is fulfilled. They include:

- Light Bulbs (see above)
- Switch Doors (see above)
- Bombs also now have the option to be created as logical entities with a specified configuration value. Bombs which have this attribute will only explode when their logical condition is fulfilled. Bombs created without this value will interact with switches in the same way as they do in the MVP, and do not interact with other logical entities or wires.

Switches and wires are not logical entities, but are conductors - they activate cardinally adjacent wires and logical entities when they are switched on or conducting. Light bulbs and switch doors can be activated but do not transmit current through themselves.

![](images/logic_conducting.png)

<center style="opacity:0.7">Assume that (1, 0) contains a boulder-activated switch.</center>
</br>

All switches and logical entities will be created in an inactive state. Wires and logical entities will also remain activated as long as there is a current from a switch running through them - if at some point there were multiple switches powering a component and one of them is turned off, the component will remain activated if there is still current that can reach it. If the source of power for a logical component has been switched off or destroyed, then the logical component will be deactivated.

Any other entities do not have conductive or logical behaviours when placed next to a conducting wire or switch.

#### b) Logical Rules

Logical entities will obey one of the following rules:

- **OR** - the entity will be activated if there is 1 or more cardinally adjacent activated conductor

- **AND** - the entity is activated if all cardinally adjacent conductors are activated. Furthermore, there must be at least 2 cardinally adjacent conductors.
![](images/logic_and.png)
<center style="opacity:0.7">The bulb can only be activated if the switch on (2, 1) and the wires on (3, 0) and (4, 1) are all activated. Hence, both switches must be switched on in order to activate the bulb.</center>
</br>

- **XOR** - the entity will be activated if there is 1 and only 1 cardinally adjacent activated conductor
![](images/logic_and.png)
<center style="opacity:0.7">The bulb can only be activated by switching on just the switch on (2, 1). If the switch on (2, 0) is turned on, then the cardinally adjacent wires on (3, 0) and (4, 1) will also conduct which do not satisfy the XOR condition. </center>
</br>

- **CO_AND** - the entity will only be activated if there are 2 or more cardinally adjacent activated conductors, which are **all activated on the same tick**, e.g. if a switch activates two wires that are both cardinally adjacent to a logical entity with the `co_and` condition, it should be activated.
![](images/logic_coand.png)
<center style="opacity:0.7">Activating the switch on (3, 1) will also activate the bulb's cardinally adjacent wires on (4, 0) and (4, 2) on the same tick, and satisfy the co_and condition. If any or both of the switches on (1, 0) and (1, 2) are activated before the middle switch then the bulb will NOT turn on as the adjacent conductors are activated on different ticks.</center>
</br>

Note that all conductor activation should be checked before before logical conditions are computed within the same tick. Activation order of the logical entities is undefined.

In the case that another conductor powers an already activated component, the current is not 'refreshed'. The `co_and` case should rely on the tick the adjacent conductor is initially powered from a deactivated state.

#### Technical Specification

The list of inputs in [Section 4.1.1. of the MVP specification](./MVP.md#411-input-specification---entities-mvp) now includes the following entities:

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Entity</th>
    <th>JSON Prefix</th>
    <th>Creatable from Dungeon Map?</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Light Bulb (off)</td>
    <td>
    <code>light_bulb_off</code>
  </td>
    <td>Yes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Light Bulb (on)</td>
    <td>
    <code>light_bulb_on</code>
  </td>
    <td>No, since light bulbs will always be created off.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Wire</td>
    <td>
    <code>wire</code>
  </td>
    <td>Yes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Closed Switch Door</td>
    <td>
    <code>switch_door</code>
  </td>
    <td>Yes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Open Switch Door</td>
    <td>
    <code>switch_door_open</code>
  </td>
    <td>No, since switch doors will always be created as closed.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

- All logical entities will be created with the field <code>logic</code> which will be one of <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, <code>xor</code>, or <code>co_and</code>. Note that light bulbs and switch doors will always be created with a logic field. Regular doors will never be created with a logic field, nor will floor switches or wires.
- Bombs may be created with the field <code>logic</code>. If they have this field, they are expected to be able to interact with other logical entities as described. Bombs created without this field function as they do in the MVP and do not need to interact with other logical entities.

# 4. Titbits

## 4.1. Git Practices 🧭

- We will not be assessing your commit messages, though for the sake of good practice you should write meaningful commits.
- The main branch should always remain stable - the pipeline should always be passing. You are welcome to comment out some of the example tests we have provided until you can get them working locally.
- When putting up Merge Requests, all changes in the diff should be relevant to the task which they relate to (not polluted with irrelevant changes, as this makes it difficult for reviewers);
- Code reviews should occur as comments on Merge Requests - if you are doing the code review synchronously leave comments on the MR as your minutes/action items

## 4.2. Assumptions 👾

As you develop your implementation of the tasks, you will undoubtedly come across scenarios where some behaviour is not properly defined by the specification. This is a complex assignment - if we defined every possible scenario, the specification would go on forever. Unlike previous courses, this one is about design. We are not trying to catch you out by testing every imaginable edge case. The autotests are there to verify that you have followed the specification and completed the work, not to trip you up on obscure edge cases.

Here are the steps you should follow if you are unsure about something in the spec:

1. Double check the spec, do a ctrl/command-f to check it isn't mentioned elsewhere, in a lot of situations this will be the case.
2. Make a post in the forum **(please search first)** asking the Course Staff whether you are able to make an assumption about the behaviour in this case. We will either:

- Approve the assumption and add to the Approved Assumptions section
- Update the specification if appropriate, or
- Respond explaining how the behaviour is defined in the scope of the specification.

Any ambiguities/assumptions that we have listed as approved **we will not be testing** in automarking.

### 4.2.1 Approved Assumptions

This list will be updated when new valid assumptions and posts are made on the forum. Please post questions in their own individual posts.

#### MVP assumptions

- The behaviour when a bomb explodes while other bombs exist in its radius is undefined
- If the cumulation of defence buffs is high enough to reduce the enemy's attack to 0, the behaviour is undefined
- Trying to mind control/bribe an ally that is already mind controlled/bribed is undefined.
- The behaviour of a moving entity, e.g. merc or player is on the square when a door closes, is undefined
- When a boulder is on top of a collectable entity it just sits there and nothing happens to the collectable. You will need to move the boulder in order to collect it.

#### Task 1) Code Analysis and Refactoring (30 marks)

**a) From DRY to Design Patterns (6 marks)**:

- None so far

**b) Pattern Analysis (6 marks)**:

- None so far

**c) Inheritance Design (6 marks)**:

- None so far

**d) Open Refactoring (12 marks)**:

- None so far

#### Task 2) Evolution of Requirements (30 marks)

The following behaviour is all undefined, and we will not test for it.

**Option 1 &mdash; Sun Stone & More Buildables (20 marks)**:

- The behaviour of possessing multiple sceptres is undefined
- When trying to open a door with both a key and a sunstone in the player's inventory, it is undefined which entity will be used.
- When a mercenary or assassin can be bribed and mind controlled at the same time, the action will be taken after the player interacts with them is undefined.
- Whether a player can wear more than one midnight armour is undefined.
- Whether midnight armour is considered a weapon is undefined

**Option 2 &mdash; Logic Switches (30 marks)**:

- A player cannot pick up the wire and light bulb and store them in their inventory
- Whether the player can stand on light bulbs is undefined
- The behaviour of whether boulders can be pushed onto wires & lightbulbs is undefined
- Whether sunstones can open switch doors is undefined
- Any scenario where the order in which activated components perform their action is undefined
  - For example, this case where a logical bomb might activate and destroy parts of a circuit before other logical components are able to activate
  ```
  bomb radius is 1;
  - : wire, S: <switch>, B: <or bomb>, L: <or light>;
  dungeon:
  S - - - - - - L
      B1 B2
  ```

## 4.3. Test Design 🐝

When it comes to writing tests for the new features, you should write functional tests on the controller.

All of the existing tests in the monolith are written in this way, and you can structure your tests similarly.

## 4.4. Dungeon Map Helper

We’ve provided a dungeon map helper [here](https://cs2511-dungeonmania-map-generator.vercel.app/) for you here to assist with visualising and creating test maps.

Please note it is not comprehensive (not all entities and fields are provided), and it may contain some bugs!

# 5. Blogging

- Complete your blog using the provided [template](./Blog_Template.md).
- Include documentation of your **design decisions** for each coding task.
- Only include **Merge Request links from GitLab**.
  - Links to external sources (e.g., Google Drive, Word documents) will **not** be marked and will be ignored.
- Your assessment will be based solely on the contents of your GitLab repository.

> You may complete your work in another tool (such as Google Docs or Word), but make sure to **upload the final PDF** to the repository, **NOT** a link.

        You will receive <strong>0/5 marks</strong> in the <strong>Easy Marks</strong> section if you fail to meet <em>any</em> of the following requirements:
        <ul>
            <li>All regression tests must pass</li>
            <li>Code coverage must remain above 80%</li>
            <li>The linter must pass</li>
        </ul>
        In simple terms, the pipeline on the <code>main</code> branch of your repository must remain green (i.e. passing) for the entire assignment.<br><br>
        If pipelines are running slowly, you’re expected to run linting and tests locally. If they pass locally, you may force merge. The purpose of the pipeline is to help you keep <code>main</code> in a working state. It’s not a hard requirement for merging.<br><br>
        <strong>Slow pipelines are not a valid excuse for failing to meet these requirements or for not merging to <code>main</code>.</strong>

        You will get 0/5 marks in this Easy Marks section if you:
        <ul>
            <li>Have Merge Requests that are too large and contain too many changes</li>
            <li>Don’t link your Merge Requests in your blog post</li>
        </ul>
        This is to make it easier for your marker to award you for your work. If you stick to the blog template, you will be fine here 🙂

## 6.2. Submission

We will take the contents of your `main` branch as your final submission. **Any commits that are made on `main` after the deadline will be counted as a late submission**. Commits to branches other than `main` will not be accepted as a valid submission.

You may be asked to explain your code or design choices to a member of staff as part of your submission.

## 6.3. Dryruns

To ensure your code **compiles with our automarker** and **basic functionality works as expected** we have provided you a basic dryrun test. If your code does not compile with our automarker, you will receive 0 for the automarking section. Any code changes to fix the compilation issue will result in a non-negotiable 20% penalty. **It is your responsibility to ensure your code compiles with our automarker**.

You can find the dryrun files here: [https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs2511/public/dryrun-files/dryrun_ass2/ ](https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs2511/public/dryrun-files/dryrun_ass2/).

**Make sure you read all of the output!**

### 6.3.1. Ensuring your code **compiles** with our tests through GitLab CI/CD pipelines.

Every time you push code to the `main` branch on GitLab or create a merge request on GitLab, an automated pipeline will run that first:

1. Compiles your code with your own tests
2. Runs your tests
3. Replaces your tests with our dryrun tests found [here](https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs2511/public/dryrun-files/dryrun_ass2/)
4. Checks if your code compiles with our tests

Note: If any of the previous steps fail, it will not run the next step.

**You should try to maintain a green pipeline on the `main` branch at all times.**

### 6.3.2. Ensuring your code **compiles and passes** with our tests through GitLab CI/CD pipelines.

Every time you push code to the `main` branch on GitLab or create a merge request on GitLab, you can click on the Green or Red indicator next to your commit. This should bring you to a page that looks like the following:

![](/images/gitlab-pipelines.png)

You can request a manual run of the pipeline by clicking on the `Run` button (see red arrow in image above). This will run the pipeline with the dryrun tests.

There are **two tasks** that can be executed. Each task will the dryrun tests for that specific task. If the build fails, then you **did not pass the dryrun test**.
